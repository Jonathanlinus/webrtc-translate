# WebRTC Translate

Highly experimental (read: "barely working") app that uses WebRTC API and WebSpeech API to provide almost (read: "not really") real-time translations during a video call. You'll need Google Translate API key to run it yourself.

You can try it out at https://github.com/szimek/webrtc-translate. It doesn't really work on a single computer, so you'll need a second one.
